            .. tab:: Question

               Draw a reference diagram for ``a`` and ``b`` before and after the third line of
               the following python code is executed:

               .. sourcecode:: python

                   a = [1, 2, 3]
                   b = a[:]
                   b[0] = 5

            .. tab:: Answer

                Your diagram should show two variables referring to two different lists.  ``a`` refers to the original list with 1,2, and 3.
                ``b`` refers to a list with 5,2, and 3 since the zero-eth element was replaced with 5.



    #.  Create a list called ``myList`` with the following six items: 76, 92.3, "hello", True, 4, 76. Do it with both append and with concatenation, one item at a time.

               Starting with the list in Exercise 2, write Python statements to do the following:

               a. Append "apple" and 76 to the list.
               #. Insert the value "cat" at position 3.
               #. Insert the value 99 at the start of the list.
               #. Find the index of "hello".
               #. Count the number of 76s in the list.
               #. Remove the first occurrence of 76 from the list.
               #. Remove True from the list using ``pop`` and ``index``.

Weekly Graded Assignment
========================

.. container:: full_width

    Write a function to find the sum of all the even numbers in a list.

    Normally we start you off by providing the function definition statement, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: python

        def launch_rockets(destination, num_passengers):
              # your code here

    But in this case we will leave that to you! In other words, you will need to write that ``def`` line yourself. Make sure you give your function the name ``sum_evens``, so that the tests work. Your function should accept one argument, the list of numbers to be summed.

    .. activecode:: ex_9_7

          # TODO
          # define a function called sum_evens, which receives one argument, a list of numbers.
          # your function should return the sum of all the even numbers in the list


          # don't copy these tests into Vocareum
          from test import testEqual

          testEqual(sum_evens([2,3,4]), 6)
          testEqual(sum_evens([]), 0)
          testEqual(sum_evens([0,7,2,4,2,1]), 8)
          testEqual(sum_evens([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]), 20)
          testEqual(sum_evens(range(200,500)), 52350)
