    #.  Create a list containing 100 random integers between 0 and 1000 (use iteration, append, and the random module).  Write a function called ``average`` that will take the list as a parameter and return the average.

               Write a Python function that will take a the list of 100 random integers between 0 and 1000 and return the maximum value.  (Note: there is a builtin function named ``max`` but pretend you cannot use it.)

    #. Write a function ``sum_of_squares(xs)`` that computes the sum
       of the squares of the numbers in the list ``xs``.  For example,
       ``sum_of_squares([2, 3, 4])`` should return 4+9+16 which is ``29``:

            .. tab:: Question

               Although Python provides us with many list methods, it is good practice and very instructive to think about how they are implemented. Implement a Python function that works like the following:

               a. count
               #. in
               #. reverse
               #. index
               #. insert

                            if e == obj:

    #. Write a function ``replace(s, old, new)`` that replaces all occurences of

       *Hint*: use the ``split`` and ``join`` methods.

Weekly Graded Assignment
========================

.. container:: full_width

    Write a function that will return a string of country codes from a string of prices that contain dollar amounts as well. Your function will take as an argument a string of prices like the following: ``"US$40, AU$89, JP$200"`` as an example. In this example, the function would return the string ``"US, AU, JP"``. **Hint:** You may want to break the original string into a list, manipulate the individual elements, then make it into a string again.

    .. activecode:: ex_9_10

       def get_country_codes(nums):
           # your code here


       # don't include these tests in Vocareum
       from test import testEqual

       testEqual(get_country_codes("NZ$300, KR$1200, DK$5"), "NZ, KR, DK")
       testEqual(get_country_codes("US$40, AU$89, JP$200"), "US, AU, JP")
       testEqual(get_country_codes("AU$23, NG$900, MX$200, BG$790, ES$2"), "AU, NG, MX, BG, ES")
       testEqual(get_country_codes("CA$40"), "CA")
