			   Write a program that allows the user to enter a string. It then prints a
			   table of the letters of the alphabet in alphabetical order which occur in
			   the string together with the number of times each letter occurs. Case should
			   be ignored. A sample run of the program might look this this::

				   Please enter a sentence: ThiS is String with Upper and lower case Letters.
				   a  2
				   c  1
				   d  1
				   e  5
				   g  1
				   h  2
				   i  4
				   l  2
				   n  2
				   o  1
				   p  2
				   r  4
				   s  5
				   t  5
				   u  1

	#. Give the Python interpreter's response to each of the following from a
	   continuous interpreter session:

	   a.
		  .. sourcecode:: python

			>>> d = {'apples': 15, 'bananas': 35, 'grapes': 12}
			>>> d['bananas']

	   b.
		  .. sourcecode:: python

			>>> d['oranges'] = 20
			>>> len(d)

	   c.
		  .. sourcecode:: python

			>>> 'grapes' in d

	   d.
		  .. sourcecode:: python

			>>> d['pears']

	   e.
		  .. sourcecode:: python

			>>> d.get('pears', 0)

	   f.
		  .. sourcecode:: python

			>>> fruits = d.keys()
			>>> sorted(fruits)
			>>> print(fruits)

	   g.
		  .. sourcecode:: python

			  >>> del d['apples']
			  >>> 'apples' in d


	   Be sure you understand why you get each result. Then apply what you
	   have learned to fill in the body of the function below:

	   .. activecode:: q2_dict_answer

		   from test import testEqual

		   #Note: The pass is a placeholder to allow
		   #the code to compile. Remove it when you
		   #begin coding.
		   def set_inventory(inventory, fruit, quantity=0):
			pass

		   # make these tests work...
		   # new_inventory = {}
		   # set_inventory(new_inventory, 'strawberries', 10)
		   # testEqual('strawberries' in new_inventory, True)
		   # testEqual(new_inventory['strawberries'], 10)
		   # set_inventory(new_inventory, 'strawberries', 25)
		   # testEqual(new_inventory['strawberries'] , 25)

		==========  ==============

		Write a program that asks the user for a sentence in English and then translates that sentence to Pirate.

		.. activecode:: ex_11_04

			from test import testEqual

			def translate(text):
				# your code here!


			text = "hello my man, please excuse your professor to the restroom!"
			testEqual(translate(text), "avast me matey, please arr yer foul blaggart to th' head!")
